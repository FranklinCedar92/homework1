Description:
This is the Module 1 Challenge. I edited the preexisting code, mostly in consolidating CSS and adding new classes in the HTML file. The Search Engine optimization link at
the top is fixed. The <div>s have all been renamed with HTML semantic titles. I reorganized the CSS file to match the order of the HTML file.

Screenshot:
